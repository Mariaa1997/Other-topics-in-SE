//1. Why do we create tests?
//Many of these apps cover a single topic, so most of the time, they are quite small. But when you create a larger application, the codebase will become bigger and more complex every time you add some features. At some point, adding code in File A will break features in File B, and to avoid these "side-effects", or at least recognize to immediately when they happen, we need to write tests our app and run them on each change.
//2. What is automated testing?
// is a technique where the Tester writes scripts on their own and uses suitable Software or Automation Tool to test the software. It is an Automation Process of a Manual Process. It allows for executing repetitive tasks without the intervention of a Manual Tester.
// It is used to automate the testing tasks that are difficult to perform manually.
// Automation tests can be run at any time of the day as they use scripted sequences to examine the software.
// Automation tests can also enter test data compare the expected result with the actual result and generate detailed test reports.
// The goal of automation tests is to reduce the number of test cases to be executed manually but not to eliminate manual testing.
// It is possible to record the test suit and replay it when required
//3. What is TDD?
//Test-Driven Development: A development methodology of writing tests first, then writing the code to make those tests pass. The process is:
//1. Define a test set for the unit
//2. Implement the unit
//3. Verifiy that the implementation of the unit makes the tests succeed.
//4. Refactor
//5. Repeat
